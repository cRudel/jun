          <h2>Helen Morgan School</h2>
          <p>
            This school was my elementary school, also known as primary school. I was here from first to fifth grade,
            with a single teacher for the whole year for one grade. My favorite class in Helen Morgan was third grade with
            Mrs. Ruvo.

            <h4>Memory from this school</h4>
            In third grade towards the end of the year the class was introduced to musical instruments to see
            if we were interested in playing. I wanted to play a stringed instrument, but I didn't want to be just
            like my sister who played the cello so I picked the viola.
