            My senior year of high school I was a pretty busy guy in the fall. I would wake up for school at a pretty unreasonable
            hour for a teenager, be at school from 7-2:30, and be at cross country practice until about 4. After that I would get home and nap, 
            then eat, then go to swim practice and get home around 9. After all that I would go and do homework until I had to go to sleep and then
            do it all again.
          </p>

            With that out of the way,
